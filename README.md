# 💼 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Dam Construction Projects

![Cost Benefit Analysis](https://github.com/SYEDFAIZAN1987/Cost-Benefit-Analysis/blob/main/pic%20cba.jpg)

## 📘 About the Project

This project conducts a **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** for two proposed dam construction projects:  
- **Dam #1 in Southwest Georgia**  
- **Dam #2 in North Carolina**

The analysis evaluates the feasibility of both projects by assessing their estimated benefits and costs across multiple categories. Using simulations, statistical modeling, and probability distributions, the project identifies the more viable dam for construction.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

1. **Estimate Benefits and Costs**:
   - Categorize and quantify benefits (e.g., navigation, hydroelectric power, recreation).
   - Calculate annualized costs (capital and maintenance).

2. **Simulation**:
   - Generate 10,000 simulations of benefit-cost ratios for each dam using the **triangular distribution**.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Evaluate variability, skewness, and kurtosis of benefit-cost ratios.
   - Fit theoretical probability distributions to observed data.

4. **Goodness-of-Fit Testing**:
   - Conduct chi-squared tests to validate the fit of theoretical distributions.

5. **Recommendation**:
   - Compare results to recommend the most economically viable project.

## 📊 Key Results

### **Dam #1:**
- **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**:
  - Mean: 1.435
  - Variance: 0.032
  - Standard Deviation: 0.181
- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher proportion of favorable BCR outcomes.
  - Greater consistency in economic performance.

### **Dam #2:**
- **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**:
  - Mean: 1.403
  - Variance: 0.025
  - Standard Deviation: 0.158
- **Key Insights**:
  - Slightly lower mean BCR compared to Dam #1.
  - Less favorable probability distribution of high BCR outcomes.

### **Recommendation**:
Based on the analysis, **Dam #1** is recommended due to its higher benefit-cost ratio and probability of favorable economic outcomes.
